# Project 1

## Overview
In this project, we want to integrate messy structured public service data with large-scale unstructured business data to uncover meaningful urban patterns. The goal is to build a pipeline that transforms raw data into a clean and integrated dataset for urban complaint analysis.

### Datasets
- Philly 311 Service Requests (CSV)
- Yelp Open Dataset (JSON)
- ADD LINK HERE

### Folder Structure
- `data/raw/`: Original datasets
- `data/processed/`: Cleaned datasets
- Hidden through `.gitignore` because the datasets are too large for GitHub
- notebooks: contains ipnyb notebooks for exploration

### How to Run
1. Install needed packages (pandas, json, os, ADD WHAT YOU USED HERE.)
2. Run notebooks in order:
     1. data_loading.ipynb
     2. initial_exploration.ipynb
     3. ADD STUFF HERE

### How to Interpret Results
